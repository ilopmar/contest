== Intro

*Polaromatic* is a web application to show a photo wall in which photos appear automatically in the browser after
applying a cool _Polaroid_ effect.

This application has been created for the

contest by https://twitter.com/gregturn[Greg Turnquist^] and *Polaromatic* source code is available at my Github

=== Application flow

There are two different ways to send a photo to the wall:

- The first one is to copy some photo files (*.jpg, *.png,...) in the _work_ directory in the same level as the
application.
- The second one is to send a photo using the Android _Share image with Polaromatic_ Application. If you use this
method you can also customize the text in the Polaroid.

This flow is explained in detail in the following sections of the documentation.

. From a browser you connect to _Polaromatic_ and just wait.
. Then, if you just copy some photos into the work directory, they are processed by the Spring Integration flow
inside the _Polaromatic_ application, converted to a cool Polaroid photo with a text and finally pushed to the
browser using Websockets.
. A _Flickr Interesing_ photos downloader as been created has a _Spring Boot CLI Application_ to download automatically
photos every 60 seconds.
. The other way to publish photos is using the _Polaromatic Android Application_ and share a photo using the application.
